#Welcome to Random-Gifs-App

- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
- To get Gifs I used [GIPHY-API](https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI)
- To make our AJAX requests, I used an AJAX library called [axios](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios).


##Functionality
- once DOM is loaded a random Gif is generated
- you can search for any keyword with a simple form
- every new Gif is added to the list of displayed Gifs
- you can remove all Gifs by clicking on the 'Delete all' button
